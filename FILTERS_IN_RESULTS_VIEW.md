# Filters in Results View - Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Feature: Filters in Results View**

I've successfully implemented comprehensive filtering functionality in the **Results View** as requested. Now users can filter comparable companies before selecting them for comparison.

## âœ… **What's Been Added**

### **1. Filter Section in Results View**

- âœ… **4 filter categories** as specified in README.md:
  - Company Size (Small, Mid, Large, Mega Cap)
  - Geography (US, Europe, Asia, Global)
  - Business Characteristics (SaaS, E-commerce, Marketplace, etc.)
  - Industry Sectors (Technology, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)

### **2. Backend Filter Support**

- âœ… **Enhanced `/api/find-comparables` endpoint** with filter parameter
- âœ… **Filter application logic** that filters companies based on market cap and characteristics
- âœ… **Real-time filtering** using FMP API data

### **3. User Interface Features**

- âœ… **Show/Hide Filters** toggle button
- âœ… **Clear All Filters** button
- âœ… **Apply Filters** button to refresh results
